      <h3>First Key Creations</h3>
      <h4>Logo design for First Key Creations.</h4>
      <p>First Key Creations is is a custom music studio created by musician, Justin Rayna. For this logo I chose to play off of the "Key" aspect of the name but not in the musical sense. Instead I wanted to portray through the logo that FKC is the key to having perfectly customized music for their clients.</p>
