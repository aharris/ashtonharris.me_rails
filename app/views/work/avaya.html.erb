    <p>The Avaya Americas International Sales and Partner Conference 2012 website/app provides attendees with useful conference, hotel, and destination guide tools. This project was interesting because we needed to created a semi-responsive desktop site and a mobile version with a dashboard landing page all based off of the same html. This was a great opportunity to get pretty creative with some css.</p>
