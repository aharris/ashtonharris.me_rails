      <h3>Secrets Vallarta Bay</h3>
      <p>
        This website is just part of a much larger project for <a href="http://amresorts.com/" target="_blank">AMResorts</a>. The goal is to create websites, with a mobile first approach, for all of their properties to act as an on location tool for their guests. The different websites for each hotel will also be combined into a mobile app available on iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry. Through the app users will have added functionality such as international calling.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was an interesting project because it combined so many different brands, all under AMResorts, like <a href="http://www.secretsresorts.com/" target="_blank">Secrets</a>, <a href="http://www.nowresorts.com/" target="_blank">Now</a>, and <a href="http://www.dreamsresorts.com/" target="_blank">Dreams</a>. It was necessary to balance the difference in each of their branding and at the same time make the sites and apps feel unified.
