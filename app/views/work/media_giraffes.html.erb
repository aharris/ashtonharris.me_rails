    <h3>Media Giraffes</h3>
    <h4>Heads Above the Rest</h4>
    <p>Media Giraffes is an internet video company specializing in digital media and video production technology. This project was a redesign of their WordPress site. I wanted to clean it up, make it simple with easy navigation while still keeping their custom WordPress functionality. I also added a mobile version of their site using WordPress Mobile Edition.</p>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
